(Trying to create a game I often played in old phones)
    In Traffic Racer, the player controls a car that appears at the center of the screen. The player can move the car left, right, up, down using the arrow keys. When the game starts, the car player should move the car and avoid the oncoming traffic. The player should avoid the incoming vehicles as much as possible. If the player collides with a vehicle, the player losses a life point, when the player collides three times with the other vehicle the game ends.
