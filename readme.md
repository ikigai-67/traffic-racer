(Trying to create a game I often played in old phones)
    In Traffic Racer, the player controls a car that appears at the bottom of the screen. The player can move the car left and right suing the arrow keys and explode coming cars using space bar. When the game begins, the car  would move on a 4 lane highway and against oncoming traffic. The player should avoid the oncoming vehicles as much as possible, the player can pick up ammos for the car's cannon; the maximum bullets that can be picked up are 5 bullets. If the player collides with a vehicle the game ends.
